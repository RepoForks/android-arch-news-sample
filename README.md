During Google I/O 2017, Android Team announced [guidelines](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html) for architecture of Android app.
This is just sample app explaining few parts of the Architecture Guidelines written in **Kotlin**, YAY!

## Components Demonstrated
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html)
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html)

## What's the app about?
It's an extremely simple app which uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to show the latest news from Google News.
It uses Retrofit 2 to fetch the news from the API.

## Steps to run:
- Go to [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and generate an API key (It's only 2 steps!)
- Put the API key at the bottom of the `gradle.properties`
`
NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
`
- Run the app
- Enjoyyyyy ðŸŽ‰
